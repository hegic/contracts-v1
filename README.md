[Hegic](https://www.hegic.co) is an on-chain options trading protocol on [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum).

The core of the Hegic Protocol V1.1 is a system of [Solidity smart contracts](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity). The main parts of the protocol are **options contracts** and **liquidity pools contracts**. Options contracts are _Call Options Contract_ and _Put Options Contract_. Liquidity pools contracts are _ETH Pool Contract_ and _ERC Pool Contract_.

## What are Options

An option is a contract giving the buyer _the right, but not the obligation_, to buy (in the case of a call option contract) or sell (in the case of a put option contract) the underlying asset _at a specific price on or before a certain date_. Traders can use on-chain options for speculation or to hedge their positions. Options are known as _derivatives_ because they derive their value from an underlying asset. Learn more about options and Hegic Protocol on [GitBook](https://hegic.gitbook.io/start/).

HegicCallOptions and HegicPutOptions are options contracts. These contracts calculate `fees` (options prices), `create` new options, `exercise` options contracts on behalf of the holders and `exchange` holders' assets using [the Uniswap Protocol](https://github.com/Uniswap) for sending liquidity back to the pool during the process of exercising.

HegicETHPool and HegicERCPool are liquidity pools contracts. These non-custodial contracts accumulate liquidity from providers (writers). Pooled liquidity is used for selling (writing) options contracts to the buyers (holders). After a liquidity provider calls the `provide` method, they send ETH / [ERC-20 tokens](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) to the liquidity pool contract and receive writeETH / writeERC (ERC-20) tokens to their address. To leave the pool a liquidity provider calls the `withdraw` method, burns their writeETH / writeERC tokens and receives ETH / ERC-20 tokens to their address.

---

ETH Call Options are created and exercised via **HegicCallOptions** and **HegicETHPool** contracts.

**ETH Call Option is an on-chain contract that gives a holder a right to swap their [DAI stablecoins](https://github.com/makerdao/dss) for [ETH](https://ethereum.org/eth/) at a fixed price during a certain period.** To activate an ETH Call Option a holder chooses the `period`, `amount` and `strike` for their option contract. After paying `fees`, the `lock` method of the HegicETHPool contract locks ETH `strikeAmount` on the pool contract. If a holder intends to swap their DAI for ETH during a fixed period that they have paid for, they call the `exercise` method. The HegicETHPool contract will receive holder's DAI and will send the amount of ETH that was locked on the contract for this particular holder. Calling the `exchange` method of the HegicETHPool contract will automatically swap DAI received from the option holder for ETH at the market price using [the Uniswap Protocol's ETH-DAI pool](https://uniswap.info/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f). After the swap, ETH is sent back to the HegicETHPool contract.

---

ETH Put Options are created and exercised via **HegicPutOptions** and **HegicERCPool** contracts.

**ETH Put Option is an on-chain contract that gives a holder a right to swap their [ETH](https://ethereum.org/eth/) for [DAI stablecoins](https://github.com/makerdao/dss) at a fixed price during a certain period.** To activate an ETH Put Option a holder chooses the `period`, `amount` and `strike` for their option contract. After paying `fees`, the `lock` method of the HegicERCPool contract locks DAI `amount` on the pool contract. If a holder intends to swap their ETH for DAI during a fixed period that they have paid for, they call the `exercise` method. The HegicERCPool contract will receive holder's ETH and will send the amount of DAI that was locked on the contract for this particular holder. Calling the `exchange` method of the HegicERCPool contract will automatically swap ETH received from the option holder for DAI at the market price using [the Uniswap Protocol's ETH-DAI pool](https://uniswap.info/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f). After the swap, DAI is sent back to the HegicERCPool contract.

## Important Warnings

**Hegic Protocol V1.1 contracts have been audited by Bramah Systems: https://bramah.systems/audits/Hegic_Audit_Bramah.pdf. However, your funds are at risk. You can lose up to 100% of the amount that you will provide to the liquidity pools contracts. There is a technical risk that the Hegic Protocol V1.1 contracts can be hacked in the future. Never provide funds to the liquidity pools contracts than you can't afford to lose. Always do your own research.**

**[Added on 28.05.2020. Fixed on 31/05/2020] ATTENTION! PLEASE READ THIS! During the first 90 days after the V1.1 contracts deployment (deployed on 30/05/2020) the owner address will be a highly privileged account. It means that the contracts will be under the owner's control. After 90 days from the `contractCreationTimestamp` time, these privileges will be lost forever and the contracts owner will only be able to use `setLockupPeriod` (LockupPeriod value can only be <60 days), `setImpliedVolRate`, `setMaxSpread` functions of the contracts.**

See below: 

    /**
     * @notice Can be used to update the contract in critical situations
     *         in the first 90 days after deployment
     */
    function transferPoolOwnership() external onlyOwner {
        require(now < contractCreationTimestamp + 90 days);
        pool.transferOwnership(owner());
    }
